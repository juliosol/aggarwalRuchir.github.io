        <p>Reinforcement learning has made great strides at exploring virtual environments, especially those of video games because of their well structured reward systems. However, it struggles in sparse reward scenarios. Curiosity driven exploration, where the agent is intrinsically motivated to explore the environment, has been proposed as a solution to this issue. Curiosity is a type of intrinsic reward function which uses prediction error as reward signal. However, current implementations of curiosity based learning only predict one time step into the future. As a result, if a catastrophic event were to happen two time steps away, the agent would be none the wiser.</p>
          
        <p>In this project,
            <ol>
                <li>We investigate the effects of generating multile step predictions into the future, and by using all predictions in our definition of curiosity.</li>
                <li>We perform experiments with different weight combinations for multiple step predictions and present results </li>
                <li>We explore the performance of our agent in different environments, 3 games from Atari suite and Super Mario Bros, and see how generalisable the learned features were.</li>
            </ol>
        </p>

        <h2>Future Work</h2>
        For future work, we intend to:
        
            <ol>
                <li>Extend our work to more Atari games to evaluate the performance over different environemnts. We also intend to extend the work to #D environments like Mujoco.</li>
                <li>Due to time constraints, we were able to perform only 2 time step predictions in the project and we want to extend it to t timesteps for future work. </li>
            </ol>
